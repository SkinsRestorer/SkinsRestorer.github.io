# Discord-MC-Chat

SkinsRestorer skins can be used for Discord-MC-Chat messages using the textures placeholder.

## Setup instructions

<Steps>
    ### Prepare your server
    Ensure [SkinsRestorer](/docs/installation) and [Discord-MC-Chat](https://modrinth.com/mod/discord-mc-chat) are installed on your server, are the latest version and are working correctly.

    ### Configure Discord-MC-Chat
    Open your Discord-MC-Chat `./config/discord-mc-chat.json` and search for the `avatarApi` section.
    The config setting looks like this:

    ```json
    "avatarApi": "https://mc-heads.net/avatar/{player_uuid}.png",
    ```

    You have to replace it with the following:

    ```json
    "avatarApi": "https://mc-heads.net/avatar/{player_textures}.png",
    ```

    ### Reload Discord-MC-Chat
    Run `/dmcc reload` in-game or in console, or `/reload` in Discord to reload.

    ### That's it!
    Now all SkinsRestorer avatars will be displayed in Discord-MC-Chat messages! ðŸŽ‰
